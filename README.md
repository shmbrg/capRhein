This project aims to predict the level of the Rhein river in Duesseldorf. For 
that reason I use level, flow, temperature and rainfall data of Dusseldorf 
and eleven other cities, which are located upstream of Duesseldorf. The data is 
collected (or aggregated) hourly for roughly 17 months (05/17-10/18). The last
two months of this data set are used as test set, to evaluate the different 
prediction models and to choose the best amongst them. Since the Rhein river has
had an alltime low in September 2018, and the data history is so short, 
predictions are rather poorly.

The data was provided by Capgemini for a workshop and is free to use.

This project is not about accuracy, it is supposed to show a way of handeling 
the problem of level forecasting of the Rhein river. It suggests the use of 
multiple models and to use its best amongst them for prediction. The project also 
demonstrates a way to implement a forecast system.
