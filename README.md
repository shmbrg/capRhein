This project aims to predict the level of the Rhein river in Duesseldorf. For 
that reason I use level, flow, temperature and rainfall data of Dusseldorf 
and eleven other cities, which are located upstream of Duesseldorf. The data is 
collected (or aggregated) hourly for roughly 17 months (05/17-10/18). The last
three days of this data set are used as test set, to evaluate the different 
prediction models and to choose the best amongst them. Since the Rhein river has
had an alltime low in 2018, and the data history is so short, predictions are 
rather poorly.

The data was provided by Capgemini for a workshop and is free to use.
